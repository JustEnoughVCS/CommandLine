    **JustEnoughVCS Upstream Vault Commands**
    This program directly creates, manages, and runs JustEnoughVCS upstream vaults.
    **Warning**: It directly operates on vault data - please operate with caution!
    * With great power comes great responsibility *

    **VAULT**:
      create <NAME>            - Create a vault in the given directory name
      init                     - Create a vault in the current directory

    **QUERY**:
      here                     - Query information about the current vault

    **MEMBERS**:
      member [list|register|remove]
        list                   - List members
        register <MEMBER_NAME> - Register a member
        remove   <MEMBER_NAME> - Remove a member

    **SERVICES**:
      service listen           - Run the server

    Additionally, you can use jvv <CMD_NAME> --help to query more detailed help!

  here: |
    **Display Vault Information Here**
    **Example**: cd ./target_dir/ && jvv here

  create: |
    **Create a new vault with the given name**
    **Usage**: jvv create <VAULT_NAME>

    **Example**: jvv create MyVault
    Creates a directory named 'MyVault' and initializes a vault inside it.

  init: |
    **Initialize a vault in the current directory**
    **Usage**: jvv init

    Uses the current directory's name as the vault name.

  member: |
    **Member Management**
    **Usage**: jvv member <register/remove> <MEMBER_NAME>

    Register or remove members based on the given member name.

    It is recommended to use the "snake_case" naming format,
    as it will be stored in this format in the configuration file
    **Example**: jvv member register vault_member

    **Query**: jvv member list
    Equivalent to running `jvv here` in the members directory.

    **Tip**: Does not manage private keys automatically. Keys must be handled manually.

  service: |
    **Service Management**
    **Usage**:
      jvv service listen - Start the server in the current vault
        You can use --port   to set the listening port,
                use --no-log to disable log output

    **Tip**: If you need to understand JustEnoughVCS collaboration paradigms, use jv docs get_started

  account: |
    **Manage Local Accounts**
    **Usage**:
    jv account list - List all accounts on this computer and whether private keys are registered
    jv account as <ACCOUNT_NAME> - Switch current account
    jv account as host/<ACCOUNT_NAME> - Switch to account in Host mode
    jv account add <ACCOUNT_NAME> - Add an account to this computer

    jv account movekey <ACCOUNT_NAME> <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE> - Move private key to specified account
    jv account genpub <ACCOUNT_NAME> <OUTPUT_DIR> - Output public key to specified directory, leave empty for current directory

    **Tip**: Use jv account add <ACCOUNT_NAME> --keygen to automatically generate ED25519 private key for your account
    **Note**: Both `--keygen` and `genpub` require your computer to be able to directly call OpenSSL command-line tools

    Accounts are identity identifiers on the local computer, each account can be associated with different private keys.
    You need to set up accounts before interacting with upstream vaults.

  sheet: |
    **Manage Sheets**
    **Usage**:
    jv sheet list - List all sheets in the upstream workspace

    jv sheet use <SHEET_NAME> - Use the specified sheet to start current work (automatically created if it doesn't exist)
    jv sheet exit - Exit current work

    jv sheet make <SHEET_NAME> - Create a new sheet for yourself
    jv sheet drop <SHEET_NAME> - Drop the sheet for others to use

    **Align**:
    jv sheet align - View all items that need alignment

    For moved items:
    jv sheet align <ITEM> [local/remote] - Align specified moved item
    jv sheet align moved [local/remote] - Align all moved items
    jv sheet align moved break - Break all move items

    For lost items:
    jv sheet align <ITEM> <CREATED_ITEM> - Point to created item to confirm move
    jv sheet align <ITEM> confirm - Confirm this file is lost
    jv sheet align lost confirm - Confirm all lost items

    For erased items:
    jv sheet align <ITEM> confirm - Confirm this file is erased
    jv sheet align erased confirm - Confirm all erased items

    jv sheet align --work - Use editor mode to align files

    Sheets are core concepts in JustEnoughVCS, each sheet represents an independent file collection.
    You can switch work between different sheets, or export files from one sheet to another.

  create: |
    **Create Workspace with Specified Name**
    **Usage**: jv create <WORKSPACE_NAME>

    **Example**: jv create my_workspace
    Creates a directory named 'my_workspace' in the current directory and initializes a workspace inside it.

    Workspace is your local working environment for file synchronization and version control with upstream vaults.

  init: |
    **Create Workspace in Current Directory**
    **Usage**: jv init

    This command creates a workspace in the current directory, with the workspace name determined by the current directory name.

    If the current directory is not empty, this operation will fail. Please ensure you execute this command in an empty directory.

  here: |
    **Query Directory Information Here**
    **Usage**: jv here

    Displays detailed information about current directory files, including:
    - File name, size, version number
    - Current file holder
    - Latest version update description

    **Tip**: Use `jv here --desc` to view the last update description for local files

  status: |
    **Display Current Sheet Status Information**
    **Usage**: jv status

    Displays the file modification status of the current sheet:
    - Added, deleted files
    - Moved files
    - Modified files

    This is a quick way to understand the current file status of the sheet.

  info: |
    **Display File Details**
    **Usage**: jv info <FILE_PATH>
    Use `--full` to view the full update history

    Display detailed information about the specified file, including:
    - File's change history
    - File's mapping in `ref`
    - File's version in `ref`

  track: |
    **Track Files to Latest Version**
    **Usage**: jv track <FILE_PATH>

    This operation is used to declare the latest valid version of a file, not simply uploading or downloading.

    **Creation**
    When there is an untracked file in the workspace, that file does not yet have a recognized version.
    Executing track will create a version record for this file, incorporate it into your sheet management, and grant you editing rights.

    **Update**
    When you hold a file and edit based on the current latest version,
    the version in your workspace will be considered the new valid version.
    Executing track will **update this version to the upstream**.

    **Synchronization**
    When you do not hold the file, edit based on outdated versions, or the file does not exist locally,
    your local modifications do not have version validity; everything follows the upstream latest version.
    Executing track will **synchronize the upstream latest version to local**.
    To overwrite local modifications, you must explicitly specify `--overwrite`.

  hold: |
    **Hold Files: Obtain File Edit Rights from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv hold <FILE_PATH>

    **Example**: jv hold src/lib.rs
    When you need to edit a file, you must first hold the file's edit rights.
    After holding a file, other collaborators will not be able to edit the same file simultaneously, avoiding conflicts.

    After editing, remember to track the file to save changes.

  throw: |
    **Throw Files: Release File Edit Rights from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv throw <FILE_PATH>

    **Example**: jv throw src/config.rs
    When you no longer need to edit a file, you can throw the file's edit rights.
    After throwing, other collaborators can hold and edit the file.

    If you have made changes to the file but haven't tracked them, throwing will lose those changes.

  move: |
    **Move Mapping**
    **Usage**:
    jv move <MAPPING> <TARGET_MAPPING> - Modify upstream mapping
    jv move <MAPPING> --erase - Erase upstream mapping

    **Examples**:
    jv move draft/character.png done/character.png - Move mapping
    jv move character.png player.png - Rename
    jv move . ../publish/ - Batch move
    jv move temp/ --erase - Erase mapping

    The move mapping operation modifies the upstream mapping and synchronizes the local structure (use `--only-remote` to cancel local modification)
    After moving, you usually need `jv align moved remote` to synchronize the local structure to the upstream

  share: |
    **Share File Visibility**
    **Usage**:
    jv share <FILE> <SHEET> <DESCRIPTION> - Share mapping to other sheets
    jv share <SHARE_ID> - Import share to current sheet

    jv share list - View incoming shares
    jv share see - View share details

    **Sharing Mode**
    The `jv share <FILE> <SHEET>` command can use the following parameters
      --work - Start editor mode for detailed sharing control

    **Import Mode**
    The `jv share <SHARE_ID>` command can use the following parameters
      --safe - Safe import, reject all conflicts, this is the default scheme
      --skip - Skip all conflicting items
      --overwrite - Force overwrite conflicting mappings, dangerous operation
      --reject - Reject this share

    **Sharing** is the simplest way to give file visibility to others

  direct: |
    **Direct to Specified Upstream Vault and Stain This Workspace**
    **Usage**: jv direct <UPSTREAM_VAULT_ADDRESS>

    **Example**: jv direct your_vault.org
    This operation connects the current workspace to the specified upstream vault and adds a stain identifier to the workspace.

    After staining, the workspace will only be able to interact with vaults of the specified identifier, ensuring data consistency.

  unstain: |
    **Unstain This Workspace**
    **Usage**: jv unstain

    **DANGER ZONE**: This operation removes the workspace's stain identifier, after which the workspace will be disconnected from the upstream vault.

    After unstaining, the workspace will no longer be associated with any specific vault and can be reconnected to other vaults.
    However, please note that this may cause data synchronization issues, use with caution.

  update: |
    **Download Latest Information from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv update

    This operation synchronizes the latest file status, sheet information, and member information from the upstream vault.

    It is recommended to perform an update operation before starting work to ensure you have the latest working environment.

  docs: |
    **Query Built-in Documentation**
    **Usage**:
    jv docs list - List all available documentation
    jv docs <DOC_NAME> - View content of specified documentation
    jv docs <DOC_NAME> -d - Print content directly

    **Example**:
    jv docs get_started
    jv docs collaboration -d

    Built-in documentation includes JustEnoughVCS usage guides, collaboration paradigms, and best practices.

  confirm:
    login: |
      You are logging into upstream vault %{upstream} as %{account}, please confirm

    unstain: |
      This operation will disconnect the current workspace from the upstream vault `%{upstream}`
      If you reconnect to a vault with a mismatched identifier, it will cause serious problems, please operate with caution!

    direct: |
      Do you want to direct the current local workspace to the upstream vault %{upstream}?

    sheet:
      make:
        restore: |

          If not, use a different name to create a sheet.

      drop: |
        Are you sure you want to drop sheet `%{sheet_name}`?
        After this, you will not be able to work in the sheet!

    track:
      prepare: |
        You are tracking %{file_counts} file(s), these files will follow the following rules
        1. New files will be uploaded and added to your sheet for management
        2. For files you held, unless they don't exist locally or versions don't match, upload logic will always be executed
        3. For files not held unless the version is frozen, download logic will always be executed to get the latest version

        **CURRENT**:
          **DOWN**: %{old_files} to sync, %{download_files} to download
          **UP**  : %{new_files} to track, %{modified_files} to update

  fail:
    std:
      current_dir: Failed to get current directory
      current_dir_name: Failed to get current directory name

    not_root_dir: This command needs to be execute in the workspace root directory!

    move:
      rename_failed: |
        **Warning**: Failed to move local file `%{from}` to `%{to}`: %{error}

      has_rename_failed: |
        **Tip**: Because the file move was skipped, a deviation will occur.
        After moving the file, be sure to use `jv align` to resolve the deviation.

      no_target_dir: |
        You did not specify a target directory to move to!
        Please use `jv move <mapping> <target_address>` to move the mapping
        or use `jv move <mapping> --erase` to erase the mapping

      count_doesnt_match: |
        You specified multiple mappings, but the target address is a single mapping.
        Please use `jv move multiple_mappings directory/` to move multiple mappings
        or use `jv move single_mapping mapping_name` to rename that mapping.

        suggestion_1: |
          **Suggestion**: Confirm [[magenta]]Erased Items[[/]]
          **Example**: Use `jv align %{example_erased} confirm` to confirm this [[magenta]]Erased Item[[/]]!

          [[yellow]]**Note**: After confirmation, the local mapping will be erased, and the file at that location will be moved away.[[/]]

        suggestion_2: |
          **Suggestion**: Confirm [[red]]Lost Items[[/]]
          Cannot determine if the intent of the file loss is [[red]]Deletion[[/]] or [[yellow]]Move[[/]]!
          **Example**: Use `jv align %{example_lost} <action>` to handle this [[red]]Lost Item[[/]]

          **Confirm Deletion**: Enter `confirm` to confirm your operation is a [[red]]Deletion[[/]]
          **Declare Move**: Enter a [[green]]Created Item[[/]] to form a [[yellow]]Move[[/]] relationship with it

        suggestion_3: |
          **Suggestion**: Align [[yellow]]Moved Items[[/]], confirm the move is based on Local or Remote
          **Example**: Use `jv align moved [local|remote]`          to batch align
                  or use `jv align %{example_moved} [local|remote]` to precisely align a move
          If this move is not what you expected,
                     use `jv align %{example_moved} break` to break them

          **Align to  Local**: Online , modify the upstream mapping to the local location
          **Align to Remote**: Offline, move the local file to the upstream location

      hint_in_reference_sheet: |
        You are accessing the **reference sheet** in **read-only** mode
        You can view file content, share visibility, and modify holding rights
        But you cannot modify the structure or submit content

      hint_as_host: |
        You are in Host mode.
        In this mode, you are the final interpreter of vault structure and version progression.
        Your operations will directly affect others' work status, and may not be reversible.

        **Structure Maintenance**
        1. You can use `jv align` or `jv move` to edit the reference sheet structure
        2. You can use `jv make` to create new reference sheets,
           or convert an unheld sheet into a reference sheet

        **Status Arbitration**
        3. You can use `jv throw` to forcibly discard everyone's edit rights
        4. You can use `jv drop` to forcibly discard others' sheets

        **Fact Advancement**
        5. You can directly use `jv track` in any sheet to advance file versions

        [[red]]**Please remember**:
        You are now the ultimate bearer of others' structure, history, and interpretive rights.
        Every operation you perform will become a fact that others must accept.[[/]]

  result:
    common:
      not_allowed_in_reference_sheet: |
        This operation is not allowed in the reference sheet!
        You cannot make any structural changes to the reference sheet
        because you are not the maintainer of the reference sheet.

        **Tip**: If you have local moves that need to be aligned,
        use `jv align moved remote` to revert the moves.

          sheet_not_found: Sheet %{sheet_name} does not exist!
          mapping_not_found: |
            Cannot get mapping for path %{path} from the sheet!
            This means the file does not exist in the sheet. If it exists locally, it may have been deleted
            Please use `jv update` to update the workspace and try again

          virtual_file_not_found: |
            Cannot read virtual file ID %{vfid} from the mapping!
            This means the mapping exists in the sheet, but the actual file information is missing!
            Please contact the upstream vault administrator for assistance

          virtual_file_read_failed: |
            Cannot read metadata for virtual file %{vfid} from the mapping!
            This means the file exists, but the mapping information is corrupted!
            Please contact the upstream vault administrator for assistance

          not_held: |
            You are not holding file %{path}!
            This means you modified the file without holding it, and the upstream vault blocked your update attempt
            (Sorry, JustEnoughVCS collaboration is based on serial editing - parallel editing and merging is not allowed)

            **Tip**: If you really need to update this file, you can follow these steps:
            1. First move the file outside the workspace and update the correct version here
            2. Use `jv info <this_file> --holder` to query the member currently editing it
            3. Try to contact them, describe your situation, and wait for them to release editing rights
            4. After editing rights are released, use `jv track <this_file>` to get the latest version from that member
            5. Manually merge your backed-up version into the latest version
            6. Update your modified latest version, then release editing rights

            Finally: You can use `jv here` to check file status in the directory before editing files to ensure you can edit

          version_dismatch: |
            The base version of the file you edited does not match the version in the upstream vault!
            Your version is %{version_current} while the upstream version is %{version_latest}, the upstream vault blocked your update

            **Tip**:
            You can use `jv jump <file> %{version_current}` to jump the version to your local version and update again
            If you don't want to force override the version, you can backup the file version, update your local version to the latest, then manually merge the files and update

            Finally: You can use `jv here` to check file status in the directory before editing files to ensure you can edit

          update_but_no_description: |
            There are update items in the files you specified, but no information provided
            You can use `jv track <file> --desc <description> -v <version>` to update files
            or use `jv track . --work` to enter the editor environment for updating

          version_already_exist: |
            The version %{version} of file %{path} you are updating already exists in the upstream vault, please use a different version number!

    move:
      success: |
        Successfully modified mapping!
        Upstream information has changed, please use `jv update` to sync to latest information

      mapping_not_found: |
        Mapping `%{path}` does not exist!
        Please check if the path you entered is correct, or use `jv update` to update workspace status

      invalid_move:
        no_target: |
          You did not specify a target address for the mapping `%{path}` to move to!
          Please use `jv move <mapping> <target_mapping>` to move the mapping
          or use `jv move <mapping> --erase` to erase the mapping

        duplicate_mapping: |
          Move operation failed because target path `%{path}` already has a mapping!
          Please change to another path, or erase the existing mapping first

      unknown: |
        Unknown move operation result!
