    **JustEnoughVCS Upstream Vault Commands**
    This program directly creates, manages, and runs JustEnoughVCS upstream vaults.
    **Tip**: It directly operates on vault data - please operate with caution!
    * With great power comes great responsibility *

    **Create Vault**:
      jvv create <VAULT_NAME> - Create a vault in the given directory name
      jvv init - Create a vault in the current directory

    **Query**:
      jvv here - Query information about the current vault
      jvv member list - Query all members

    **Member Management**:
      jvv member <register/remove> <MEMBER_NAME> - Register or remove members

    **Service**:
      jvv service listen - Run the server in the current vault

    Additionally, you can use jvv <CMD_NAME> --help to query more detailed help!

  here: |
    **Display Vault Information Here**
    **Example**: cd ./target_dir/ && jvv here

  create: |
    **Create a new vault with the given name**
    **Usage**: jvv create <VAULT_NAME>

    **Example**: jvv create MyVault
    Creates a directory named 'MyVault' and initializes a vault inside it.

  init: |
    **Initialize a vault in the current directory**
    **Usage**: jvv init

    Uses the current directory's name as the vault name.

  member: |
    **Member Management**
    **Usage**: jvv member <register/remove> <MEMBER_NAME>

    Register or remove members based on the given member name.

    It is recommended to use the "snake_case" naming format,
    as it will be stored in this format in the configuration file
    **Example**: jvv member register vault_member

    **Query**: jvv member list
    Equivalent to running `jvv here` in the members directory.

    **Tip**: Does not manage private keys automatically. Keys must be handled manually.

  service: |
    **Service Management**
    **Usage**:
    jvv service listen - Start the vault server in the current vault to accept client connections
      You can use --no-log to disable log output
