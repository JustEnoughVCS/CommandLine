    **JustEnoughVCS Upstream Vault Commands**
    This program directly creates, manages, and runs JustEnoughVCS upstream vaults.
    **Warning**: It directly operates on vault data - please operate with caution!
    * With great power comes great responsibility *

    **VAULT**:
      create <NAME>            - Create a vault in the given directory name
      init                     - Create a vault in the current directory

    **QUERY**:
      here                     - Query information about the current vault

    **MEMBERS**:
      member [list|register|remove]
        list                   - List members
        register <MEMBER_NAME> - Register a member
        remove   <MEMBER_NAME> - Remove a member

    **SERVICES**:
      service listen           - Run the server

    Additionally, you can use jvv <CMD_NAME> --help to query more detailed help!

  here: |
    **Display Vault Information Here**
    **Example**: cd ./target_dir/ && jvv here

  create: |
    **Create a new vault with the given name**
    **Usage**: jvv create <VAULT_NAME>

    **Example**: jvv create MyVault
    Creates a directory named 'MyVault' and initializes a vault inside it.

  init: |
    **Initialize a vault in the current directory**
    **Usage**: jvv init

    Uses the current directory's name as the vault name.

  member: |
    **Member Management**
    **Usage**: jvv member <register/remove> <MEMBER_NAME>

    Register or remove members based on the given member name.

    It is recommended to use the "snake_case" naming format,
    as it will be stored in this format in the configuration file
    **Example**: jvv member register vault_member

    **Query**: jvv member list
    Equivalent to running `jvv here` in the members directory.

    **Tip**: Does not manage private keys automatically. Keys must be handled manually.

  service: |
    **Service Management**
    **Usage**:
      jvv service listen - Start the server in the current vault
        You can use --port   to set the listening port,
                use --no-log to disable log output

      docs <DOC_NAME>               - View content of specified documentation

    You can use jv <COMMAND_NAME> --help to query more detailed help!

    **Tip**: If you need to understand JustEnoughVCS collaboration paradigms, use jv docs get-started

  account: |
    **Manage Local Accounts**
    **Usage**:
    jv account list - List all accounts on this computer and whether private keys are registered
    jv account as <ACCOUNT_NAME> - Switch current account
    jv account add <ACCOUNT_NAME> - Add an account to this computer
    jv account remove <ACCOUNT_NAME> - Delete this account
    jv account movekey <ACCOUNT_NAME> <PRIVATE_KEY_FILE> - Move private key to specified account

    Accounts are identity identifiers on the local computer, each account can be associated with different private keys.
    You need to set up accounts before interacting with upstream vaults.

  sheet: |
    **Manage Sheets**
    **Usage**:
    jv sheet list - List all sheets in the upstream workspace

    jv sheet use <SHEET_NAME> - Use the specified sheet to start current work (automatically created if it doesn't exist)
    jv sheet exit - Exit current work

    jv sheet make <SHEET_NAME> - Create a new sheet for yourself
    jv sheet drop <SHEET_NAME> - Drop the sheet for others to use

    Sheets are core concepts in JustEnoughVCS, each sheet represents an independent file collection.
    You can switch work between different sheets, or export files from one sheet to another.

  create: |
    **Create Workspace with Specified Name**
    **Usage**: jv create <WORKSPACE_NAME>

    **Example**: jv create my_workspace
    Creates a directory named 'my_workspace' in the current directory and initializes a workspace inside it.

    Workspace is your local working environment for file synchronization and version control with upstream vaults.

  init: |
    **Create Workspace in Current Directory**
    **Usage**: jv init

    This command creates a workspace in the current directory, with the workspace name determined by the current directory name.

    If the current directory is not empty, this operation will fail. Please ensure you execute this command in an empty directory.

  here: |
    **Query Directory Information Here**
    **Usage**: jv here

    Displays detailed information about current directory files, including:
    - File name, size, version number
    - Current file holder
    - Latest version commit information

    This is a quick way to understand the current state of your workspace directory.

  track: |
    **Track Local Files**
    **Usage**: jv track <FILE_PATH>

    **Example**: jv track src/main.rs
    First track - Create and upload the "First Version", then automatically hold them
    Subsequent tracks - Update files with new versions

    Tracking files is the basic operation of version control, ensuring your changes can be synchronized to the upstream vault.

  hold: |
    **Hold Files: Obtain File Edit Rights from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv hold <FILE_PATH>

    **Example**: jv hold src/lib.rs
    When you need to edit a file, you must first hold the file's edit rights.
    After holding a file, other collaborators will not be able to edit the same file simultaneously, avoiding conflicts.

    After editing, remember to track the file to save changes.

  throw: |
    **Throw Files: Release File Edit Rights from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv throw <FILE_PATH>

    **Example**: jv throw src/config.rs
    When you no longer need to edit a file, you can throw the file's edit rights.
    After throwing, other collaborators can hold and edit the file.

    If you have made changes to the file but haven't tracked them, throwing will lose those changes.

  move: |
    **Move Local Files**
    **Usage**:
    jv move <SOURCE_FILE> <TARGET_LOCATION> - Safely rename or move files
    jv move auto - Automatically handle local file moves or renames

    **Example**:
    jv move old_name.txt new_name.txt
    jv move src/old_dir/file.rs src/new_dir/file.rs
    jv move auto

    Safe move operations preserve file version history, while auto-move detects and handles all renames.

  export: |
    **Export Files to Import Area of Other Sheets**
    **Usage**: jv export <FILE> <TARGET_SHEET> -m <DESCRIPTION> -n <PACKAGE_NAME>

    **Example**: jv export data.csv analytics -m "Export analysis data" -n "analysis_data"
    This operation packages the specified files and sends them to the import area of the target sheet.

    Other collaborators can use the jv import command in the target sheet to import these files.

  import: |
    **Import Files to Current Sheet**
    **Usage**:
    jv import <PACKAGE_NAME> - Import files from import area
    jv import <REFERENCE_SHEET_PATH> - Import files from reference sheet

    **Example**:
    jv import Player_Import - From import area defined name
    jv import ref@Data/Player.csv - From reference sheet path

    Import operation copies files from other sheets or import areas to the current workspace.

  direct: |
    **Direct to Specified Upstream Vault and Stain This Workspace**
    **Usage**: jv direct <UPSTREAM_VAULT_ADDRESS>

    **Example**: jv direct your_vault.org
    This operation connects the current workspace to the specified upstream vault and adds a stain identifier to the workspace.

    After staining, the workspace will only be able to interact with vaults of the specified identifier, ensuring data consistency.

  unstain: |
    **Unstain This Workspace**
    **Usage**: jv unstain

    **DANGER ZONE**: This operation removes the workspace's stain identifier, after which the workspace will be disconnected from the upstream vault.

    After unstaining, the workspace will no longer be associated with any specific vault and can be reconnected to other vaults.
    However, please note that this may cause data synchronization issues, use with caution.

  update: |
    **Download Latest Information from Upstream Vault**
    **Usage**: jv update

    This operation synchronizes the latest file status, sheet information, and member information from the upstream vault.

    It is recommended to perform an update operation before starting work to ensure you have the latest working environment.

  docs: |
    **Query Built-in Documentation**
    **Usage**:
    jv docs list - List all available documentation
    jv docs <DOC_NAME> - View content of specified documentation
    jv docs <DOC_NAME> -e - Return temporary path of specific documentation for editor opening

    **Example**:
    jv docs get-started
    jv docs collaboration -e | nano

    Built-in documentation includes JustEnoughVCS usage guides, collaboration paradigms, and best practices.
